# Nested Post

This content is located at `content/posts/nested-post/index.mdx`.

## Assets

This structure allows you to keep images and other assets co-located with the markdown file.

> Note: To serve these images, you would typically need a build step to copy them to the public directory or use a Next.js plugin that handles relative imports in MDX.
