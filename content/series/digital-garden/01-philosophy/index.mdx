Digital gardening is the act of cultivating a personal knowledge base in public. Unlike traditional blogs, which are linear and time-bound, a digital garden is non-linear and evolving.

## Why a Garden?

Traditional blogging is like a stream. Posts flow past you and disappear into the archive. A garden is like a network. Ideas are planted, linked, and grown over time.

### Core Principles

1. **Topography over Chronology**: Content is organized by topic and relationship, not just by date.
2. **Growth**: Notes start as "seedlings" and evolve into "evergreen" content.
3. **Public Learning**: Sharing the process of learning, not just the final result.

> "A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust." — Gertrude Jekyll
