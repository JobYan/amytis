Building a robust digital garden requires a flexible architecture. Amytis uses a blend of static generation and dynamic client-side enhancements.

## The Stack

- **Next.js 16**: The backbone of our routing and static generation.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For austere, elegant styling.
- **Unified/Remark/Rehype**: The engine that transforms MDX into interactive content.

### Asset Pipeline

Our custom `copy-assets.ts` script ensures that images located next to your markdown files are correctly mapped to the public directory during the build process. This allows for a clean developer experience where images and text live together.
